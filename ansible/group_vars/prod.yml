# Production environment variables
# These override defaults from vms.yml for production environment
# Production environment uses stricter, more conservative defaults

# Docker service configuration (disabled in prod by default)
docker_enabled: false
docker_users: []  # Empty by default - add users explicitly if needed

# Example: Production-specific overrides
# vm_timezone: "UTC"  # Explicit UTC for production
# Additional production hardening can be added here
